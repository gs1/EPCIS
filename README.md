# EPCIS
Draft files being shared for EPCIS 2.0 development. The repository is organised by work streams, one folder for each work stream (e.g., JSON/JSON-LD, REST bindings, etc.)

Commenting has now closed.  Many thanks to everyone who has provided feedback.
The editorial team has already begun reviewing every comment received and will be making improvements accordingly.

Please use this link to download the .zip (including the public review drafts of the EPCIS / CBV 2.0 standards).
Please do not attempt to submit any public review comments as GitHub issues - we needed them to be submitted via the official GS1 mechanism so that they can be formally considered by the work group.  

Anyone was able to submit comments, whether you participate in the GS1 Global Standards Management Process (GSMP) or not - further details were at the link above.
