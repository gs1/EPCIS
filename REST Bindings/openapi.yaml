        The `OPTIONS` method is used as a discovery service for `/capture`. It describes

        - which EPCIS and CBV versions are supported,
        - the EPCIS and CBV extensions,
        - the maximum payload size as count of EPCIS events (`GS1-EPCIS-Capture-Limit` header) or as a maximum payload size in bytes (`GS1-EPCIS-Capture-File-Size-Limit` header)
        - what the server will do if an error occurred during capture (`GS1-Capture-Error-Behaviour` header).

        The list of headers is not exhaustive. It only describes the functionality specific to EPCIS 2.0.

      description: |
        EPCIS events are added in bulk using the capture interface. Four design considerations were made to remain compatible with EPCIS 1.2:

        - EPCIS 2.0 keeps event IDs optional. If event IDs are missing, the server should populate the event ID with a unique value.
        Otherwise, it won't be possible to retrieve these events by eventID.
        - By default, EPCIS events are only stored if the entire capture job was successful. This behaviour can be changed with the `GS1-Capture-Error-Behaviour` header.
        - EPCIS master data can be captured in the header (`epcisHeader`) of an `EPCISDocument`.
        - This endpoint should support both `EPCISDocument` and `EPCISQueryDocument` as input.

        To prevent timeouts for large payloads, the client potentially may need to split the payload into several capture calls. To that end, the server can specify a capture
        limit (number of EPCIS events) and file size limit (payload size).

        A successful capturing of events does not guarantee that events will be stored. Instead, the server returns a
        capture id, which the client can use to obtain information about the capture job.

        The server returns a 'Link' header to point to the remaining results.

        The client can further restrict the list of events returned by filtering events using the EPCIS query
        language using URL query string parameters as specified by the<a href="https://github.com/gs1/EPCIS/tree/master/REST%20Bindings/query-schema.json">EPCIS Query Language</a>.  
        The parameter `eventCountLimit` is used to restrict the maximum number of
        events to be returned in total, whereas `perPage` restricts the number of events to return per page or paginated results.

      description: |
        EPCIS 2.0 implementations must support Webhook subscriptions. 
        Creating a query subscription requires the client to provide a single endpoint to which the
        server will send events (as `EPCISQueryDocument`) and an optional string `signatureToken`. 
        This `signatureToken` must be generated by the client and is used by the server to authenticate itself and sign messages when sending events. The signature must be contained on the `GS1-Signature` HTTP header of the server request. 
        
        The choice of signature type is implementation specific but examples would be using HMAC with SHA-256 directly or a wrapper supporting various symmetric or asymetric 
        cryptographic algorithms such as Json Web Signature (JWS).

        When the client subscribes to a query, it must either set `stream` to `true`, to be notified whenever a new EPCIS
        event matches the query, or the client must define a query schedule. If these are missing the query subscription is invalid because the server won't
        know when to notify a client.

        ## Scheduled query: Receive query results at 1.05am

        A scheduled query subscription is a time-based query execution. EPCIS 2.0 scheduled queries are scheduled
        in the same manner as cron jobs.

        For example, this query subscription is scheduled to trigger every morning at 1.05am. By setting
        `reportIfEmpty` to `true`, the client's callback URL (`dest`) will be called even if there are no new events that match
        the query.

        ```
        POST /queries/MyQuery/subscriptions
        {
          "dest": "https://client.example.com/queryCallback",
          "signatureToken": "13df38d8275b13f05704629e5f1cf3d45d6132d5",
          "reportIfEmpty": true,
          "schedule": {
            "hour":"1",
            "minute": "5"
          }
        }
        ```

        ## Streaming query subscription: Whenever a captured EPCIS event matches the query criteria

        If no query schedule is specified, the client must explicitly set `stream` to `true`. This restriction is to
        prevent clients from accidentally subscribing to EPCIS event streams.

        ```
        POST /queries/MyQuery/subscriptions
        {
          "dest": "https://client.example.com/queryCallback",
          "signatureToken": "13df38d8275b13f05704629e5f1cf3d45d6132d5",

        The `GET` endpoint  is to retrieve results of a named query.
        Furthermore, this endpoint can also be used to subscribe to queries using Websocket. To do this, the client
        must specify the query schedule or set the `stream` parameter to `true` as a URL query string parameter. Please
        note that scheduling parameters and the `stream` parameter are mutually exclusive.

        ## Scheduled query: Receive query results at 1.05am

        Handshake from client for scheduled query:

        ```
        GET https://example.com/queries/MyQuery/events?minute=5&hour=1
        Host: example.com
        Upgrade: websocket
        Connection: Upgrade
        ```

        Handshake from the server:

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
        Upgrade: websocket
        Connection: Upgrade
        ```

        ## Streaming query subscription: Whenever a captured EPCIS event matches the query criteria

        Handshake from client for streaming:

        ```
        GET https://example.com/queries/MyQuery/events?stream=true
        Host: example.com
        Upgrade: websocket
        Connection: Upgrade
        ```

        Handshake from the server:

        ```

        Upgrade: websocket
        Connection: Upgrade

    CaptureJob:
      description: |
        When EPCIS events are added through the capture interface, the capture process can run asynchronously. If the payload
        is syntactically correct and the client is allowed to call `/capture`, the server returns a `202` HTTP response code. This
        does not guarantee successful storage of all EPCIS events. The capture job exposes the state of the capture job to the client.

        A capture job document has at least the following properties:

        - `running`: whether or not the capture job is still active.
        - `success`: whether or not at least one error occurred.
        - `captureErrorBehaviour`: GS1-Capture-Error-Behaviour header value provided with POST data to capture.
        - `errors` or `errorFile`: with the errors if `success` is `false`.

        ### captureErrorBehaviour value is `rollback`

        | Capture job `running` | Capture job `success` | Capture job outcome |
        |:--------|:---------|:---------|
        | `true` | `true` | Still capturing EPCIS events. No errors occurred so far. |
        | `true` | `false` | At least one error occurred. Rollback is in progress. |
        | `false` | `true` | All EPCIS events are captured. |
        | `false` | `false` | All EPCIS events are rejected. |

        ### captureErrorBehaviour value is `proceed`

        | Capture job `running` | Capture job `success` | Capture job outcome |
        |:--------|:---------|:---------|
        | `true` | `true` | Still capturing EPCIS events. No errors occurred so far. |
        | `true` | `false` | At least one error occurred but more EPCIS events are currently being captured. |
        | `false` | `true` | All EPCIS events were captured without an error. |
        | `false` | `false` | Some EPCIS events were captured but errors occurred. |

        If `success` is `false`, check the `errors` or `errorFile` property for details.

    PerPage:
      description: |
        This parameter helps to control the amount of data returned to the client through pagination.
        In the case of EPCIS events, `perPage` specifies the maximum number of events in a response to the client.
        It does not mandate that the server reaches this limit. For example, if the server sees that some EPCIS events are very
        large, the server can decide to return fewer events to avoid creating an error because the response body is too
        large.

        As long as there are more resources to retrieve, the `Link` header contains the URL of the next page and
        the attribute `rel="next"`. The last page is indicated by the absence of the `rel="next"`. Depending on the
        implementation, there can be a global upper limit for the `perPage` value that the client cannot override,
        which should be stated in the documentation.

        Parameter that points to the next list of results when requesting a list of events that is larger than the value
        specified with the `perPage` parameter. Some technologies refer to this as scrolling.
        A `nextPageToken` may be invalidated through timeout. It is up to the specific implementation to provide
        the mechanisms for invalidating tokens.

    QueryScheduleSubscription:
      description: |
        A scheduled query subscription is a time-based query execution scheduler. EPCIS 2.0 scheduled queries are scheduled
        in the same manner as cron jobs.

        For example, this query subscription is scheduled to trigger every morning at 1.05am. By setting
        `reportIfEmpty` to `true`, the client's callback URL will be called even if there are no new events that match
        the query.

        ```
        POST /queries/MyQuery/subscriptions
        {
          "dest": "https://client.example.com/queryCallback",

    GS1-Capture-Error-Behaviour:
      description: |
        A header to control how the capture interface will behave in case of an error:

        - `rollback`: "All or nothing". Either the capture job is entirely successful or all EPCIS events are rejected.
        - `proceed`: "Greedy capture". The capture interface tries to capture as many EPCIS events as possible, even if there are errors.
        - `all`: This is to be used only by the server to announce it supports both `rollback` and `proceed`.

        The default behaviour is `rollback`, as in EPCIS 1.2.

        As long as there are more resources to retrieve, the `Link` header contains the URL of the next page and
        the attribute `rel="next"`. The last page is indicated by the absence of the `rel="next"`.
