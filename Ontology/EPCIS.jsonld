Because there are situations in which associations are more permanent, i.e. beyond the physical flow of goods (e.g. packing/unpacking and loading/unloading), an AssociationEvent SHOULD be used: (a) when objects need to be associated with a physical location or (b) when the parent object could also be subject to other, more temporary associations (i.e. captured using AggregationEvent).",

Note: The eventTime applies to the completion of a business step, not a sensor observation. For instance, for a receiving event accommodating a sensor element, the eventTime indicates when goods were received ' it gives no information when certain conditions (e.g. a specific temperature value) held true. In some circumstances, event and sensor observation times may correspond though (e.g. if a quality inspector checks certain properties of goods). In such cases, indicating the eventTime may be sufficient.",
