However, the AggregationEvent does not allow for associations of objects with physical locations;  if action is DELETE while omitting the childEPC and childQuantityList field, all contained children are disaggregated from the containing parent. Because there are situations in which associations are more permanent, i.e. beyond the physical flow of goods (e.g. packing/unpacking and loading/unloading), an AssociationEvent SHOULD be used: (a) when objects need to be associated with a physical location or (b) when the parent object could also be subject to other, more temporary associations (i.e. captured using AggregationEvent).",
