In such an event, there is a set of 'contained' objects that have been aggregated within a 'containing' entity that's meant to identify the aggregation itself.  This event type is intended to be used for 'aggregations', meaning an association where there is a strong physical relationship between the containing and the contained objects such that they will all occupy the same location at the same time, until such time as they are disaggregated."@en ;

Like the AggregationEvent, the AssociationEvent is also used to capture associations where there is a strong physical relationship between the containing and the contained objects such that they will all occupy the same location at the same time, until such time as they are disaggregated. However, the AggregationEvent does not allow for associations of objects with physical locations;  if action is DELETE while omitting the childEPC and childQuantityList field, all contained children are disaggregated from the containing parent. Because there are situations in which associations are more permanent, i.e. beyond the physical flow of goods (e.g. packing/unpacking and loading/unloading), an AssociationEvent SHOULD be used: (a) when objects need to be associated with a physical location or (b) when the parent object could also be subject to other, more temporary associations (i.e. captured using AggregationEvent)."@en ;

If present, the time value SHALL be less (earlier) than or equal to the eventTime value.  It SHALL also contain a time zone offset value.  The coordination and integrity of distributed computing requires time synchronisation of EPCIS events conveying sensor data. Therefore, when populating the time, startTime, and endTime field, EPCIS capture applications SHOULD apply established time synchronisation protocols such as IEEE 1588-2008, which provides a standard method to synchronise device clocks in a network.  Note: The eventTime applies to the completion of a business step, not a sensor observation. For instance, for a receiving event accommodating a sensor element, the eventTime indicates when goods were received ' it gives no information when certain conditions (e.g. a specific temperature value) held true. In some circumstances, event and sensor observation times may correspond though (e.g. if a quality inspector checks certain properties of goods). In such cases, indicating the eventTime may be sufficient."@en ;
