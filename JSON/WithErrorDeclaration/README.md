Events that involve `ErrorDeclaration` and `correctiveEventID`:

- `ErrorDeclarationAndCorrectiveEvent.jsonld`: transformation event (commissioning)
- `Example_9.6.1-ObjectEvent-with-error-declaration.jsonld`
  - TODO: this uses `urn:uuid:` which is not recommended for `eventID`, the `correctiveEvents` are not shown, and has a disconnected `receiving` event
